# PySpark_MultiClass
Multi-Class Image Classification Using Pyspark
The model uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to achieve an accuracy within mid 90% range

The significant contribution achieved here is a method to handle data stored in file directory structure where the directory name indicates the class label It also implements how to extract, process and transform features from images and use them to train models.

The notebook was trained on google colab with spark alloted 12gb of memory to be able to process the images.
